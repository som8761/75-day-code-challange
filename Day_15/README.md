# Number Guessing Game
This project is a simple Number Guessing Game where users can input a number and try to guess a randomly generated number.

## Features: âœ¨
Number Guessing: Users can input a number and try to guess a randomly generated number.
Dynamic Feedback: The game provides feedback to users based on their guesses, informing them whether they guessed too high, too low, or correctly.
User Interaction: Users can submit their guesses and receive immediate feedback.

## Technologies Used: ðŸ’»
HTML: Used to structure the webpage.
CSS: Used for styling the elements and creating a visually appealing layout.
JavaScript: Used to handle the game logic, generate random numbers, and update the DOM dynamically.

## JavaScript Functionality: ðŸ”§
Random Number Generation: JavaScript generates a random number between 1 and 100 for users to guess.
User Interaction: JavaScript handles user input, compares it with the random number, and provides feedback accordingly.
DOM Manipulation: JavaScript updates the DOM to display feedback messages to the user.

## Why JavaScript: ðŸš€
JavaScript was chosen for its versatility and ability to handle user interaction effectively. It allows for dynamic updating of the webpage based on user input, providing an interactive and engaging experience for players.

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements:
In the future, I plan to enhance this project by adding features such as a score tracker to keep track of the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number. Additionally, I'll explore adding difficulty levels to adjust the range of numbers for users to guess.
