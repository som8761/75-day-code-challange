# Spread and Rest Operators in JavaScript
## Introduction
Spread and rest operators are powerful features introduced in JavaScript to manipulate arrays and function arguments more efficiently. While they have similar syntax, they serve different purposes, providing greater flexibility and versatility in your code.

## Spread Operator
The spread operator (...) in JavaScript is used to break down an array into its individual elements. It allows you to spread array elements wherever multiple elements are expected, such as when creating new arrays, passing function arguments, or merging objects. This feature provides a convenient and concise way to work with arrays and make your code more readable and expressive.

## Rest Operator
The rest operator (...) in JavaScript is used to gather or collect multiple individual elements (arguments) into a single array within a function declaration. This enables functions to accept an indefinite number of arguments, providing flexibility and versatility in handling data. The rest operator simplifies code and makes it more concise, especially when dealing with functions that operate on varying numbers of inputs.

## Key Differences
Spread Operator: Breaks down an array into its individual elements, used for creating new arrays, passing function arguments, or merging objects.
Rest Operator: Gathers multiple individual elements into a single array within a function declaration, used for handling an indefinite number of function arguments.
Using these operators enhances the usability and adaptability of your code, allowing you to handle different scenarios and input data effectively.
