# Understanding Asynchronous JavaScript
## Introduction
This readme is intended to help you understand the code provided, which demonstrates the use of asynchronous JavaScript, specifically with async/await and Promises.

## Code Overview
The HTML file contains JavaScript code inside the <script> tags. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

1. delayGreeting Function
This function demonstrates the use of async/await. It delays printing "Hello world" to the console by one second using setTimeout. The function is marked as async to allow the use of await inside it.

2. Fetching Data with Promises
getDataWithPromises Function
This function fetches data from an API (https://fakestoreapi.com/products) using fetch() and returns a Promise. It resolves with the response from the API.

Using Promises
The function getDataWithPromises is called, and then then() is used to handle the response. Inside the then() block, another Promise is created to parse the response JSON. Finally, the parsed data is logged to the console.

3. Fetching Data with Async/Await
getDataWithAsyncAwait Function
This function achieves the same task as getDataWithPromises but uses async/await syntax for asynchronous operations. It fetches data from the same API and then parses the JSON response.

Using Async/Await
The function getDataWithAsyncAwait is called directly, and await is used to fetch data from the API and parse the JSON response. This makes the code more readable and concise compared to the Promise approach.

## Conclusion
Both approaches achieve the same result of fetching data asynchronously from an API. The Promise approach is more traditional, while the Async/Await approach provides cleaner and more readable code, especially when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations.
