## Overview
The setTimeout function in JavaScript allows you to execute a function or code snippet after a specified delay in milliseconds.

## Examples
Example 1: Display a Message After a Delay
The displayMessage function logs a message to the console after a delay of 3000 milliseconds using setTimeout.

Example 2: Using setTimeout with Anonymous Function
An anonymous function is used with setTimeout to log a message to the console after a delay of 2000 milliseconds.

Example 3: Delayed Action with Parameters
The funcName function accepts a parameter and performs an action after a delay of 4000 milliseconds using setTimeout.

Example 4: Change Text After a Delay
The text inside a <p> element is changed to a new message after a delay of 5000 milliseconds.

Example 5: Show a Countdown
A countdown from 5 to 1 is displayed, with each number appearing after a delay of 1000 milliseconds using setTimeout.

Example 6: Reveal Hidden Content
A hidden element is revealed after a delay of 2000 milliseconds using setTimeout.

Example 7: Delayed Function Execution
Three functions (funcA, funcB, and funcC) log messages to the console after delays of 2000, 4000, and 6000 milliseconds, respectively, using setTimeout.

Example 8: Countdown Timer
A countdown timer is displayed, starting from 10 and decreasing by 1 every second until reaching 1, using setTimeout.
