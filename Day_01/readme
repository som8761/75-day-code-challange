Introduction:
JavaScript offers multiple ways to declare variables, each with its own scope and rules. This README aims to clarify the differences between var, let, and const declarations and provide guidance on their appropriate usage.

Variable Declaration in the Same Scope
var:
Global scope: Variables declared with var are accessible globally.
Redeclarable and Reassignable: You can redeclare and reassign variables declared with var within the same scope.

let:
Block scope: Variables declared with let are limited to the block they are defined in.
Cannot be Redeclared, but can be Reassigned: You cannot redeclare the same variable with let within the same scope, but you can reassign its value.

const:
Block scope: Variables declared with const are also limited to the block they are defined in.
Cannot be Redeclared or Reassigned: You cannot redeclare or reassign variables declared with const within the same scope.
