🔍 Today's Project: Number Guessing Game 🧑‍💻



🌟 Project Description:



Today, I worked on a Number Guessing Game as part of my coding challenge. The Number Guessing Game allows users to input a number and try to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range.



💡 Key Features:



Users can input a number and attempt to guess the randomly generated number.

The game provides feedback on whether the user's guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Feedback messages are dynamically displayed to guide the user through the guessing process.

The game keeps track of the number of attempts taken by the user.

🌐 Technologies Used:



HTML: Used for structuring the webpage.

CSS: Used for styling the elements and creating an appealing layout.

JavaScript: Implemented game logic, random number generation, and DOM manipulation for dynamic interaction.



Keep coding, keep learning, and let's crush our coding goals together! 💪
