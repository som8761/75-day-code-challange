# Vowel Checker 📝

This application checks for the presence of vowels in a given text input.

## Features: ✨
- **Check Vowel:** Users can input text and check for the presence of vowels by clicking the "Check Vowel" button.
- **Clear All:** Users can clear the input field by clicking the "Clear All" button.

## Technologies Used: 💻
- HTML: Used for structuring the webpage.
- CSS: Used for styling the elements and creating an attractive layout.
- JavaScript: Responsible for checking vowels in the input text and providing feedback.

## How to Use: 📝
1. Open the webpage in a web browser.
2. Enter text in the input field labeled "Enter a Text".
3. Click the "Check Vowel" button to check for vowels in the input text.
4. To clear the input field, click the "Clear All" button.

## Note: Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser for the application to function properly.

## Future Enhancements: 🚀
In the future, I plan to enhance this project by:
- Adding functionality to count the number of each vowel (a, e, i, o, u) separately.
- Implementing a feature to ignore case sensitivity when checking for vowels.
- Enhancing the user interface for better user experience.
