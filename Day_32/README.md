# Form Validation Project

## Description
This project is part of my 75-day code challenge where I focused on building a form validation system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project was to create a user-friendly form that validates user input for various fields such as name, email, phone number, password, and confirm password.

## Key Features
Input Validation: Implemented form validation to ensure accurate user input.
Field Validation: Validated fields including name, email, phone number, password, and confirm password.
Regular Expressions: Utilized regular expressions for email and password validation.
Error Messages: Incorporated error messages to provide clear feedback to users.
Local Storage: Integrated localStorage to store form data even after refreshing the page.
Password Strength Checker: Implemented a password strength checker to guide users in creating secure passwords.

## Usage
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
Fill out the form fields and observe the validation messages.
Submit the form to see the success message if all fields are valid.
