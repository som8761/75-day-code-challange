## 🚀 Day 6 of the #75DayCodeChallenge 🚀

Welcome to Day 6 of my coding journey! This README.md file documents my progress and learnings for today's coding session. Let's dive in!

### 🔍 Today's Focus: JavaScript Loops and Iterations

#### 🎯 Achievements:
1. Mastered the `while` loop for repetitive tasks.
2. Calculated the sum of even numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop.
3. Explored the `do...while` loop for executing code at least once.
4. Updated HTML elements dynamically using JavaScript.
5. Learned about the `forEach` loop for iterating over arrays.

#### 🔑 Key Takeaways:
- Understanding loop constructs is crucial for efficient programming.
- Iterating over arrays and performing tasks on each element enhances productivity.
- Consistency and practice are key to mastering programming concepts.

Let's keep pushing boundaries and coding towards our goals! 💪 #JavaScript #CodingJourney #Programming #NeverStopLearning
