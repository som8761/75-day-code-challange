# Operators in JavaScript

This repository contains JavaScript code demonstrating different kinds of operators and their usage. The code examples cover arithmetic operators, assignment operators, comparison operators, logical operators, and the ternary operator.

## Description

### 1. Arithmetic Operators
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulus (%) - Returns the remainder of a division.
- Increment (++) - Increases the value of a variable by 1.
- Decrement (--) - Decreases the value of a variable by 1.

### 2. Assignment Operators
- Assignment (=)
- Addition assignment (+=)
- Subtraction assignment (-=)
- Multiplication assignment (*=)
- Division assignment (/=)
- Modulus assignment (%=)

### 3. Comparison Operators
- Equal to (==)
- Not equal to (!=)
- Strict equal to (===)
- Strict not equal to (!==)
- Greater than (>)
- Less than (<)
- Greater than or equal to (>=)
- Less than or equal to (<=)

### 4. Logical Operators
- Logical AND (&&)
- Logical OR (||)
- Logical NOT (!)

### 5. Ternary Operator
- Ternary operator (?:) - a short form of the conditional operator.

## Usage

Each section in the code file provides examples and explanations of the respective operators. Feel free to explore and understand how these operators work in JavaScript.
