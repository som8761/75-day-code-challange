# Understanding Promises in JavaScript
This repository contains JavaScript code demonstrating the concept of Promises in JavaScript. Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript, providing a way to execute code asynchronously and handle the result (or error) once it's available.

## Contents
Introduction to Promises:
The code includes simple examples illustrating the creation and usage of Promises.
It covers the three states of a Promise: pending, resolved, and rejected.
Examples demonstrate how to handle these states using .then() and .catch() methods.

## Square Number Promise:
A Promise function squareNumber is implemented, which takes a number as input and resolves with the square of that number after a delay of 1 second.
The example showcases how to create and use a Promise in JavaScript.

## Random Quote Generator:
This part of the code fetches a list of quotes from an API using Promises.
A random quote is displayed each time the page is refreshed or when the user clicks a button.
It demonstrates how to fetch data asynchronously and update the page dynamically.

## Handling Errors in Promises:
Error handling in Promises is demonstrated through examples.
It includes scenarios where Promises resolve successfully and when they encounter errors.
Examples showcase the usage of .catch() to handle errors gracefully.

## Async/Await:
Async/Await syntax is introduced as an alternative to chaining .then() methods.
Examples show how to use async functions and await keyword to simplify asynchronous code.

## Usage
To run the examples:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Open the browser's developer console to view the output.
The console will display messages indicating the progress of each Promise operation.

## Learn More
This code serves as a good starting point for understanding the usage and benefits of Promises in JavaScript. Further exploration can be done through various online tutorials and documentation available on Promises and asynchronous JavaScript programming.
